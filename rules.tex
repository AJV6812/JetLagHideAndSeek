\begin{contract}
    \Clause{title=Game Boundaries}

    This version of Hide and Seek is to be played across Opal-compatible stations and services in NSW.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \setlength{\leftskip}{3em}
        \item All non-bus transport stations (excluding Hunter Line, Bombaderry, Berry, Gerringong, Rydal, Tarana, Bathurst, stations between Emu Plains and Doonside inclusive and stations between Merrylands and Liverpool inclusive.) are available hiding spots.
        \item All opal-compatible services can be used by both the hider and seeker.
    \end{enumerate}

    The borders of the game are defined by the Game Area link, and neither the hider nor seeker are permitted to leave this area during the game.

    The game will start on the 31st of January at 9am and will finish by 8pm.

    \Clause{title=Hiding Period}

    At the start of each round, one team will become the hider while the other becomes seekers. The order that teams become hiders should be determined randomly. The members of each team should stay together at all times.

    All players will start the game at Epping Library.

    The seekers must carry the seeker phone with them at all times with location services on, while the hider carries the hider phone with them.

    The first 60 minutes of a round is the hiding period, during which only the hider may move.

    At the end of the hiding period, the hider must be within 500m of a non-bus transit station and not on transport. If there are multiple stations within 500m, the hider must choose one to be "their" station.

    For the rest of this round, the hider must stay within 500m of that station.

    After this, the seeking phase begins.

    \Clause{title=Asking Questions}

    At any time in the seeking phase, the seekers can ask questions from the list defined in \referClause{questions}.

    The hider must answer each question truthfully within 5 minutes (or 10 minutes for photo questions).
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \setlength{\leftskip}{3em}
        \item While the seekers are waiting for a hider to respond to a question, they may not ask another question.
        \item If the question is not answered within the allotted time, the hider's time is paused until the question is answered and the hider receives no reward.
    \end{enumerate}

    Seekers are not permitted to use Google Street View or a similar tool. Additionally, seekers may not search for station images or open the images tab of a station on Google Maps. Looking at uploaded images of business on Google Maps is permitted.

    \Clause{title=Hider Deck}

    After the hider answers a question, they will draw and keep a certain number of cards as defined in \referClause{questions}.

    If a question is asked multiple times, the hider receives their reward multiple times. For example, if this is the second time a question has been asked, the hider draws a certain number of cards and keeps some, then repeats this a second time. If it was the third time, they would do this process three times, and so on.

    The hider can keep a maximum of 6 cards in their hand at any time (unless expanded by a powerup).

    \begin{enumerate}
        \setlength{\leftskip}{3em}
        \item If the hider exceeds this hand limit, they must immediately play or discard cards until they are within the limit.
    \end{enumerate}

    \Clause{title=End Game}

    Once the seekers have entered the hiding zone, but are no longer on public transport, the end game will begin.

    At the time when the end game begins, the hider must be in a publically accessible hiding spot, and must stay in that hiding spot for the rest of the game.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \setlength{\leftskip}{3em}
        \item Your hiding spot must be publically accessible during all game hours.
        \item Your hiding spot must be somewhere you can stay for multiple hours (for this reason it is recommended not to use stores or other businesses).
        \item There must exist a walking route given by Google Maps that goes within 3m of your final hiding spot.
    \end{enumerate}

    If because of the restrictions of the end game (or for any other reason), answering a question is impossible, then the hider may reply "I cannot answer this question" and still receive a reward.

    Once the hiders are within 2 meters and have spotted the seekers, the hider's time is calculated as the total time of the seeking phase plus any time bonuses that are still in the hider's hand.

    After this, the new hider has up to 10 minutes of planning before they start their hiding period. During this time, ensure the hiders have the hider phone and the seekers have the seeker phone. Then the game continues from the last hider's hiding position.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \setlength{\leftskip}{3em}
        \item If the hider's transit station was an intercity station (one that can only be accessed by SCO, STH, CCN, BMT, etc) or the Newcastle Light Rail, the next hider has the option to move their starting location to the closest metropolitan station.
        \item If this happens, both the hiders and the seekers will travel together to that station. As soon as everyone disembarks and the train leaves, the hiding phase of the next round begins on the platform.
    \end{enumerate}

    Once every team has hidden once, the game ends and the team with the longest hiding time wins.

    A hider can hide for a maximum of 3.5 hours, after which they must reveal their location to the hiders.


    \Clause{title=Questions}\label{clause:questions}

    There are 6 categories of questions that can be asked.
    
    Many questions refer to particular classes of locations. In this case, the Google Maps category will be used to determine which locations are included, and any distances are measured from the Google Maps pin (this applies even if erronous, unless all players agree otherwise). Additionally, only locations within the map's borders are valid answers.

    If a question refers to the hider's location, it should be measured to their location at the time of answering, not the location of their transit station.

    In general, the seekers should clarify any ambiguity in the question (for example sending a screenshot of every valid amusement park).

    A matching question follows the format "Is your nearest [LOCATION TYPE] the [SEEKER'S NEAREST LOCATION TYPE]?"

    \begin{enumerate}
        \setlength{\leftskip}{3em}
        \item The hider's reward for answering a matching question is to draw 3 cards and keep 1 of them.
        \item The full list of matching questions can be found in \referArticle{matchingQuestions}.
    \end{enumerate}

    A measuring question follows the format "Is your nearest [LOCATION TYPE] closer than [DISTANCE TO SEEKER'S NEAREST LOCATION TYPE]?"

    \begin{enumerate}
        \setlength{\leftskip}{3em}
        \item The hider's reward for answering a measuring question is to draw 3 cards and keep 1 of them.
        \item The full list of measuring questions can be found in \referArticle{measuringQuestions}.
    \end{enumerate}

    A radar question follows the format "Are you within [DISTANCE] of the seekers?"

    \begin{enumerate}
        \setlength{\leftskip}{3em}
        \item The hider's reward for answering a radar question is to draw 2 cards and keep 1 of them.
        \item The full list of radar questions can be found in \referArticle{radarQuestions}.
    \end{enumerate}

    A thermometer question follows the format "After travelling at least [DISTANCE] am I closer than I was?"

    \begin{enumerate}
        \setlength{\leftskip}{3em}
        \item If you wish to start a thermometer question, you must first send a Google Maps pin of your current location. Then after travelling at least the appropriate distance (as the crow flies) send a pin of your new location.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \setlength{\leftskip}{6em}
            \item If you ask another question while the thermometer is active, it is considered cancelled. The hider does not receive a reward.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item The hider's reward for answering a thermometer question is to draw 2 cards and keep 1 of them.
        \item The full list of thermometer questions can be found in \referArticle{thermometerQuestions}.
    \end{enumerate}

    The seekers may ask photo questions from one of the provided categories. If it is not possible for the hider to send a photo that matches the specification, they can reply "I cannot answer the question" but still receive a reward.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \setlength{\leftskip}{3em}
        \item The hider has 10 minutes to answer the photo question.
        \item The photo must be taken with the hider phone's normal aspect ratio.
        \item The hider may censor text in photos before sending.
        \item If the seekers ask or receive an answer to a photo question within 10 minutes of arriving in the hider's hiding zone, the hider can pause the game for 10 minutes to finish taking the photo if necessary and move to a final hiding spot. The seekers cannot move during this time, and the hider's clock is paused.
        \item The hider's reward for answering a photo question is to draw 1 card.
        \item The full list of photo questions can be found in \referArticle{photoQuestions}.
    \end{enumerate}

    A tentacles question follows the format "Within 2km of me which [LOCATION TYPE] are you nearest to?"

    \begin{enumerate}
        \setlength{\leftskip}{3em}
        \item If the hider is not within 2km, the hider can respond that they are not within reach and still receive a reward.
        \item The seeker should provide a list of each valid location within 2km of their current location.
        \item The hider's reward for answering a tentacles question is to draw 4 cards and keep 2 of them.
        \item The full list of tentacles questions can be found in \referArticle{tentaclesQuestions}.

    Time bonuses give extra time only if held in hand until the end of the game. The time granted ranges from 3 minutes to 18 minutes.

    A randomise card can be played in response to any question asked by the seekers (within the allotted answer window).

    \begin{enumerate}
        \setlength{\leftskip}{3em}
        \item When played, the seekers randomly choose between the unasked questions in the same category. This question is asked instead.
        \item The hider only receives a reward for answering the randomised question.
        \item The original question is not considered to have been asked, so can be asked again.
    \end{enumerate}

    A veto card can be played in response to any question asked by the seekers (within the allotted answer window).

    \begin{enumerate}
        \setlength{\leftskip}{3em}
        \item When played, the question does not have to be answered by the hider.
        \item The hider receives no reward.
        \item The original question is considered to have been asked, so if asked again will be for an increased price.
    \end{enumerate}
